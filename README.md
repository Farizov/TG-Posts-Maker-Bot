## What T4BT Bot can do.
 - Creating a post(s) with content:
   * text message;
   * image;
   * regular video;
   * video in a circle;
   * GIF animation;
   * audio file;
   * voice message.
 - Ability to set a description for each media file being sent.
 - In the description to the media file, as well as simply in a text post, spintax is supported, format: `{Text_1|Text_2|Text_3|Text_4}`.
 - MARKDOWN format is also supported to create a hyperlink in the description to the media file or in a regular text post, format `[Link Text](https://www.example.com)`.
 - Ability to create a post with buttons under the post, as well as without buttons.
 - Ability to select the number of buttons per post, as well as the number of buttons in a row.
 - When creating buttons, spintax is supported, format: `{Button1|Button2} | {{https|http}://example1.com/|{https|http}://example2.com/}`. Data for generating a button can be sent both as text to the bot and as a text file (to create a large volume of posts).
 - Ability to add a random variable to each link in the button in the form of `https://example1.com?jd73hddsk83`.
 - Ability to create a link to a message to go to a post in the form: `https://t.me/YourBotName_bot?start=c747ca0a61d46131`.
 - Ability to separately create a default post (aka default post) for the bot. Those. at any transition to the bot (directly by username), each visitor will be shown this post. It may differ from those created posts that are intended for mailing.
 - Ability to run the bot through a proxy.
 - Ability to run the bot for a specified period of time.
 - Multi-access to the post database on one PC, i.e. the database of created posts can be accessed from any running bot on the same machine.
 - Ability to run multiple bots on the same PC.
 - Binding the key to the hardware, with the ability to reset the key. Reset is free.
 - Detailed step-by-step instructions inside the bot.
 - The bot is available in four languages: üá∫üá∏ üá∑üá∫ üá™üá∏ üá®üá≥.
 - Free updates.
 - Online support.


## T4BT Bot operating mode.
 - In `INLINE` mode - the most promising and effective method.
   * This is your own aka `@postbot`, only with a TG username created by you for your personal project or offer!
   * The main difference from the standard postbot is that it generates not one, but many unique IDs for one post or many created posts.
   * Using text randomization both for the description of the media file and for a simple text post, each message sent using one of the IDs will be unique.
   * The same applies to the media file in the post, i.e. each post sent will have a unique media file identifier.
   * The same will apply to the buttons in the post, i.e. each post will have a unique button, of course, provided that the button is set by spintax. For example: `{Button1|Button2} | {{https|http}://example1.com/|{https|http}://example2.com/|...}` and so on 1-2-5-10 thousand variations separated by a forward slash (`|`).


## In the `regular bot` mode.
   * In this mode, a separate link with a unique ID will be generated for each post to go to the post by clicking on the `/start`    button.
   * The whole process of post uniqueization is identical to that described above.


## To start the bot you will need:
   * Your bot's bot token from `@BotFather`.
   * Telegram ID of the account that will be the bot's admin for managing and creating posts.
